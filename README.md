## Documentation

The bracket uses a special **"Pool to Double-Elimination"** format:

- Seeded players are first sorted in a serpentine pattern in groups of 3~4 depending on the number of participants. 
Group match winners proceed to "Winner's Bracket", losers proceed to "Loser's Bracket".

- There can be up to 3 groups of 3 participants in the pool phase; if the number of participants isn't a multiple of 4, then: `number_of_groups_of_3 = 4 - (number_of_participants % 4)`

This bracket system also advantages a higher seed in many ways:

- Group matches count ties as wins for the higher seeded player to advantage a higher seed. In the double-elimination phase however, a strict win is required.

Although the system advantages high seeds, it still gives lower-seeded players more chances than a regular double-elimination tournament would by making the lowest possible amount of matches played before elimination 3 (this increases to 4 if the player is in a 4-player-group, which in a bigger tournament is more likely).
